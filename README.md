# To Pneumonia or not Pneumonia...

Final project - Data Analytics Iron Hack

## Pneumonia detector in chest X-Ray images

In the previous images **we can't distinguish the case with pneumonia against the case without pneumonia** if don't
know anything about chest X-Ray reading.



In the previous graph we can observe that **the data is unbalanced**, because we have more Pneumonia cases than Normal.

We have to **rebalance** the data to train better a neural network.

We are going to **generate random images of Normal cases**.
